# Voting example DApp on Truffle Framework.

This is a DApp example on Ethereum local network using Truffle Framework.

We develop a DApp where the users can create proposals and vote them. Of course, they can vote once per proposal with the options in support, against or absence.


# Preconditions

This dapp is based on the official tutorial of Truffle Framework: http://truffleframework.com/tutorials/pet-shop. So, I strongly recommend to read it before.

You need to pay attention to configure and run Ganache (for a local blockchain) and MetaMask (for a client web blockchain).
